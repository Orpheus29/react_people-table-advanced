<h2 align="center">📋About📋</h2>

This is a table containing information about individuals (fullname, gender, years of life, parents' names) with the ability to filter by gender, perform a query search in the search bar, and filter by the century of birth (you can select several centuries).

Female names are highlighted in red, while male names are in blue.

The list can be sorted in ascending or descending order based on name, gender, birth and death years.

When clicking on a color-highlighted parent's name, the cursor highlights the corresponding row with his/her data in the list.
